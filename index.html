    <h1>Wireframing</h1>

    Wireframes are blueprints for websites. Websites are too complex to design them at once, like a print.Wireframes are drafts, what show the structure and the operation of thw website but not the design.

    <p>They are easy to create and change, so ideal way to make your ideas clear. Today we show thwm to clients. That's why we don't use any real design elements (colors, images, fonts and typography). We have to make clear, that they are blueprints, not graphics designs.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
    <li>Inspire yourself! Search onepagers what solve the same or similar problems than yours.
      (<a href="onepagerlove.com">onepagerlove.com</a>  is a good start)
    <li>Prepare your wireframe in Figma. You will need some real screen size setup (a desktop computer and a moblile) and some components.Good idea to make components for image and video placeholders, for title, subtitle and bread text. You will need a button, and a sticky note is also useful. (My example wireframe's link is below)
    <li>Decide your basic margins. You will need two sets: one for keeping the content in center on big desktop screens and an other what serves as margin for text on mobile.
    </ol>
